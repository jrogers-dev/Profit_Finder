#Profit Finder Deux: Son of Profit Finder

Profit Finder was originally a webscraping script written in Python, using Scrapy to go through lists of products on brick-and-mortar retail store websites. It would fetch prices and compare them to prices on Amazon to look for large discrepencies that could be turned into a profit by buying the product from the store and reselling on Amazon.

The original having been lost to time, negligence, bit rot or whatnot, the new Profit Finder aims to not only fill those shoes, but outgrow them as well. No longer just a script, the new and improved Profit Finder will have a React-based frontend, with Rails on the backend and Nokogiri doing the scraping.
